Overview of the Task

TASK ONE: LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES on BostonHousing.csv Dataset

Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like
square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the
Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.



Objective:-

To predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, using Linear Regression. The goal is to understand the relationships between these features and housing prices to provide accurate price predictions.


Key Activities:-

Data Preparation: Load and explore the dataset (e.g., Boston Housing dataset).
Handle missing or inconsistent data through imputation or removal.
Select relevant features and preprocess data for modeling.

Feature Engineering: Approximate square footage using existing data (e.g., average number of rooms).
Represent location using proximity to key areas or dummy variables.
Derive insights from existing features to create meaningful predictors.

Model Implementation: Split data into training and testing sets.
Train a Linear Regression model on the selected features.
Test the model to evaluate performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and 
R*2score.

Visualization: Plot actual vs. predicted values for interpretability.
Identify feature importance and their impact on housing prices.

Evaluation and Insights: Interpret the modelâ€™s performance.
Suggest improvements or highlight feature relevance in price prediction.


Technologies Used:-

Python: For data processing, model building, and evaluation.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
Scikit-learn: To implement Linear Regression and evaluate performance metrics.
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting and exploratory data analysis.
Dataset: Boston Housing dataset (or a similar structured dataset for housing price prediction).
